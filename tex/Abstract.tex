We investigate the application of numerical approximations via Chebyshev expansions and the KPM to study valley dynamics present in graphene subject to external magnetic fields. The use of linear scaling quantum transport (LSQT) techniques allows the realistic approximation of the time evolution and the quantum projection operators; we validate the resulting alogrithms by comparison of a linear chain system with periodic boundary conditions, which due to its simplicity allows us to approximate its properties using exact terms. Of specific interest is the study of the valley relaxation time in graphene, which is of importance in the characterization of valleytronics, an emerging area similar to spintronics, that centers on valley information transfer as well as the manipulation of its degrees of freedom.

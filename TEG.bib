Bei dem durch Reduktion erhaltenen Präparat wurden mit der Adsorption aus wäßriger Lösung größere spez. Oberflächen gefunden, als mit der Gasadsorption oder aus der katalytischen Leistung. Die größte spez. Oberfläche wurde direkt in der bei der Reduktion erhaltenen Suspension gemessen. Die niederen Werte der spez. Oberfläche sind eine Folge der Agglomeration bei der Isolierung. Im Gegensatz dazu gaben bei dem durch Verpuffen erhaltenen Präparat alle Methoden gleiche spez. Oberflächen. Dieser Unterschied wird darauf zurückgeführt, daß die Folien des durch Verpuffen von G. O. erhaltenen Präparates im Gegensatz zu denen des Reduktionsproduktes durchlöchert sind. Die Messung der katalytischen Leistung ergab, daß die Bromwasserstoff-Bildung an den Basisflächen des Kohlenstoffs erfolgt.},

The nonlocality is consistent with the long-range flavor currents induced by the lifting of spin/valley degeneracy. The effect is expected to contribute strongly to all magnetotransport phenomena near the neutrality point.},

  abstract     = {We report a simultaneous increase of carrier concentration, mobility and photoresponsivity when SiC-grown graphene is decorated with a surface layer of colloidal PbS quantum dots, which act as electron donors. The charge on the ionised dots is spatially correlated with defect charges on the SiC-graphene interface, thus enhancing both electron carrier density and mobility. This charge-correlation model is supported by Monte Carlo simulations of electron transport and used to explain the unexpected 3-fold increase of mobility with increasing electron density. The enhanced carrier concentration and mobility give rise to Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the magnetoresistance, which provide an estimate of the electron cyclotron mass in graphene at high densities and Fermi energies up to 1.2  ×  10 13 cm −2 and 400 meV, respectively.},

There has already been some research on manipulating individual sheets on HOPG surfaces with scanning probe microscope tips; such sheets were obtained either accidentally or with a less controllable indenting technique. Here we present a different approach, which is more reliable and controllable. The HOPG surface was first patterned to create an array of small graphite islands by reactive ion etching of the HOPG surface with an oxygen plasma. These islands were then manipulated with an atomic force microscope tip. Carbon nanotubes represent a promising material for nanotechnology and can be considered as a graphene sheet rolled into a seamless cylinder. While carbon nanotubes are synthesized successfully with laser ablation, carbon arc, or chemical vapour deposition techniques, we speculate that it might be possible, by the controlled fabrication of graphene sheets, to form nanotubes or other novel motifs of use for nanotechnology.},

An equation of         state, relating temperature, disorder, and bare conductivity, is         presented. In two dimensions, the semimetallic phase is         unstable.

  abstract     = {Modern electronic structure calculations are predominantly implemented         within the super cell representation in which unit cells are         periodically arranged in space. Even in the case of non-         crystalline materials, defect-embedded unit cells are commonly         used to describe doped structures. However, this type of         computation becomes prohibitively demanding when convergence         rates are sufficiently slow and may require calculations with         very large unit cells. Here we show that a hitherto unexplored         feature displayed by several 2D materials may be used to achieve         convergence in formation- and adsorption-energy calculations         with relatively small unit-cell sizes. The generality of our         method is illustrated with Density Functional Theory         calculations for different 2D hosts doped with different         impurities, all of which providing accuracy levels that would         otherwise require enormously large unit cells. This approach         provides an efficient route to calculating the physical         properties of 2D systems in general but is particularly suitable         for Dirac-point materials doped with impurities that break their         sublattice symmetry.},

  abstract   = {The goal of this book is to expose the reader to the indispensable role that mathematics plays in modern physics. Starting with the notion of vector spaces, the first half of the book develops topics as diverse as algebras, classical orthogonal polynomials, Fourier analysis, complex analysis, differential and integral equations, operator theory, and multi-dimensional Green's functions. The second half of the book introduces groups, manifolds, Lie groups and their representations, Clifford algebras and their representations, and fibre bundles and their applications to differential geometry and gauge theories.This second edition is a substantial revision with a complete rewriting of many chapters and the addition of new ones, including chapters on algebras, representation of Clifford algebras, fibre bundles, and gauge theories. The spirit of the first edition, namely the balance between rigour and physical application, has been maintained, as is the abundance of historical notes and worked out examples that demonstrate the "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics" in modern physics.},

  abstract    = {In recent years, the role of predictive computational modeling has become a cornerstone for the study of fundamental electronic, optical, and thermal properties in complex forms of condensed matter, including Dirac and topological materials. The simulation of quantum transport in realistic materials calls for the development of linear scaling, or order-$N$, numerical methods, which then become enabling tools for guiding experimental research and for supporting the interpretation of measurements. In this review, we describe and compare different order-$N$ computational methods that have been developed during the past twenty years, and which have been intensively used to explore quantum transport phenomena in disordered media. We place particular focus on the electrical conductivities derived within the Kubo-Greenwood and Kubo-Streda formalisms, and illustrate the capabilities of these methods to tackle the quasi-ballistic, diffusive, and localization regimes of quantum transport. The fundamental issue of computational cost versus accuracy of various proposed numerical schemes is addressed in depth. We then extend the review to the study of spin dynamics and topological transport, for which efficient approaches of inspecting charge, spin, and valley Hall conductivities are outlined. The usefulness of these methods is illustrated by various examples of transport in disordered materials, such as polycrystalline and defected graphene models, 3D metals and Dirac semimetals, carbon nanotubes, and organic semiconductors.},

  abstract     = {Graphene subjected to chiral-symmetric disorder is believed to host zero energy modes (ZEMs) resilient to localization, as suggested by the renormalization group analysis of the underlying nonlinear sigma model. We report accurate quantum transport calculations in honeycomb lattices with in excess of $10^{9}$ sites and fine meV resolutions. The Kubo dc conductivity of ZEMs induced by vacancy defects (chiral BDI class) is found to match $4e^{2}/\pi h$ within 1% accuracy, over a parametrically wide window of energy level broadenings and vacancy concentrations. Our results disclose an unprecedentedly robust metallic regime in graphene, providing strong evidence that the early field-theoretical picture for the BDI class is valid well beyond its controlled weak-coupling regime.},

  abstract  = {The motion of conduction electrons in a metal in an electric field, scattered by an irregular static potential, is considered; this model is applicable to the resistance due to lattice waves at high temperatures, and to imperfections at any temperature. In §2 the Boltzmann equation is re-derived without the customary perturbation theory, avoiding the usual necessity of averaging over phases of different electron states after repeated small time intervals. The assumption that the scattering centres are distributed at random in the crystal is alone sufficient. The theory is, however, still dependent on assuming that h/τ<<kT, where τ is the collision time, as is the usual perturbation theory. §3 gives a general formula for the conductivity of the model, not subject to any assumption. This helps to justify an argument by Landau according to which the usual theory is valid provided h/τ<<η, where η is the cut-off energy of the Fermi distribution. No direct evaluation of the formula has been achieved.},
